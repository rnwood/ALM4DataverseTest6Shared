This repo contains:
- an advanced and extendable application lifecycle management (ALM/CI-CD)
implementation for Dataverse.
- a set of process documentation and guidance on how to use and extend it.

Supports both **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions** (PREVIEW).

Features:

- Handles zero to many Dataverse solutions per repo.
- Correctly determines the install/upgrade/update method for each solution based on the state of the target environment
- Supports branches, PRs etc with minimal re-configuration
- Supports including config/system/lookup data
- Easy to extend using the extensive PowerShell ecosystem.


## Getting Started

### GitHub Actions

1) Run the automated setup script in Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   iwr https://github.com/ALM4Dataverse/ALM4Dataverse/releases/latest/download/setup-github.ps1 | iex
   ```

    The setup script automatically detects whether GitHub environment approvals are
    available for your repository and chooses the matching deployment strategy
    (`environment-approval` or `manual-gate-tag` with prefixed repo-level credentials).

   Or follow the [GitHub Actions Setup Guide](docs/setup/github-setup.md) to configure manually.

### Azure DevOps

1) Run the automated setup script in Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   iwr https://github.com/ALM4Dataverse/ALM4Dataverse/releases/latest/download/setup-azdo.ps1 | iex
   ```

   Or follow the [Manual Setup Guide](docs/setup/azdo-manual-setup.md) if you prefer manual configuration.
   See the [Automated Setup Guide](docs/setup/azdo-automated-setup.md) for details.
